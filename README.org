TV Overlord is a *semi automatic* command line tool to download and
manage TV shows from newsgroups or bittorent.  It will download nzb
files or magnet links.

It searches multiple sites simultaneously and combines the results into
one list to select from.

TV Overlord keeps track of which shows have been downloaded and what
shows are available to download.

For each new episode of a tv show you are tracking, you are given a
list of possible downloads to choose.  If you use a torrent search
provider, a magnet link is passed to the default bittorent client.  If
it is an NZB search, an NZB file is placed in a folder that is
configured in the configuration file.

For torrent files, you can also have your shows organized after
downloading.  If you use transmission or deluge, those clients can be
configured to call a script when each torrent is complete.  This
script will extract the video file from the downloaded folder, rename
it, and put it in a separate folder organized into sub folders named
for each tv show.

There are several bittorent search providers and two NZB search
providers and new ones can be added fairly easily.  See the
search providers [[https://github.com/8cylinder/tv-overlord/tree/master/tvoverlord/search_providers][README.org]], or by making a feature request in issues
or a pull request.

**** Why semi automatic

Semi automatic means that you manually run it and select from a list
each episode you want.  The reason for this is that not all torrents
follow a naming convention that is parsable, especially for more obscure
shows.  So instead of writing a ton of code to try and figure out
information about an episode, I'll use the parser built into my brain.
Also I like that it runs when I like, its light weight, and there are
no background processes.

** Install

**** Requirements

Python 3.4 (or higher) -- on Linux, OSX, or Windows

**** Install

TV Overlord is a python 3 application and can be installed via pip3.

: sudo pip3 install tvoverlord

After its installed, you run it by typing:

: tvol --help

The first time it's run, it will create the appropriate config dir for
your platform and put the database and config.ini there.

After that you can start to use it, type:

: tvol add 'Doctor Who'

If this is the wrong show, try again but add the year:

: tvol add 'Doctor Who 2005'

Then

: tvol download

To get help for each command, you can use:

: tvol download --help
: tvol add --help
: # etc...

If you use Bash as your shell, you can have tab completions.  Add this
to your .bashrc file:

: eval "$(_TVOL_COMPLETE=source tvol)"


**** Setup the post download script

If you use Transmission or Deluge as your bittorent client there is a
script for each called transmission_done and deluge_done.  These will
take the episode that was downloaded and copy it to a folder where it
will be organized by how the template string in config.ini is
configured.

[[https://github.com/8cylinder/tv-overlord/wiki/Post-download-scripts][Setup and configure post download scripts details]]


** Configure

TV Overlord looks for the database and =config.ini= in the appropriate
directory for your platform.  When tvoverlord is first run, it will
create a tvoverlord directory there.

  + OSX :: =~/Library/Application Support/tvoverlord=
  + Linux :: =~/.config/tvoverlord=
  + Windows :: =C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\tvoverlord=
