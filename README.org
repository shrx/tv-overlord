TV Overlord is a command line tool to download and manage TV shows
from newsgroups or bittorent.  It will download nzb files or magnet
links.

TV Overlord keeps track of which shows have been downloaded and what
shows are available to download.

For each new episode of a tv show you are tracking, you are given a
list of possible downloads to choose.  If you use a torrent search
provider, a magnet link is passed to the default bittorent client.  If
it is an NZB search, an NZB file is placed in a folder that is
configured in the configuration file.

For torrent files, you can also have your shows organized after
downloading.  If you use transmission or deluge, those clients can be
configured to call a script when each torrent is complete.  This
script will extract the video file from the downloaded folder, rename
it, and put it in a seperate folder organized into sub folders named
for each tv show.

There are serveral bittorent search providers and two NZB search
providers and new ones can be added fairly easily.  See the
search providers [[https://github.com/8cylinder/tv-overlord/tree/master/tv/search_providers][README.org]], or by making a feature request in issues
or a pull request.

** Install

TV Downloader has been tested on Linux and Mac.  It would probably not
be to hard to make it work on windows, and if anyone is interested, I
can take a look at making it work or alternatively send me a pull request.


*** Dependencies

TV Overlord requires some additional python libraries (not part of
the standard packages) to be installed:
  1. *tvdb_api* - [[https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api]] \\
     Python library to access the thetvdb.com api
  2. *Requests* - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/  \\
     Library to download html pages
  3. *Beautiful Soup* - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ \\
     Python library used to scrap thepiratebay.org since they don't have an api
  4. *Feedparser* - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser \\
     For sites that provide an xml api this library is used to parse them
  5. *Docopt* - [[http://docopt.org/]] \\
     The best library for handling command line arguments
  6. *Dateutil* - https://labix.org/python-dateutil \\
     Some usefull extentions to the datetime module


*** Install steps

  1. =pip install tvdb_api beautifulsoup4 feedparser requests docopt python-dateutil=
  2. Create a dir somewhere and clone this repository: \\
     =git clone https://github.com/smmcg/tv-downloader.git=
  3. Put the dir on your $PATH or symlink tvoverlord to a dir that is
     on the path.
     (I have it symlinked to =tv= in a bin dir thats on the path)
  4. type: =tvoverlord= \\
     The first time its run, it will ask to create the
     config dir.  Type =Y= to allow it.  The config directory will be
     created in your home dir called =.tv-downloader/=
  5. Type =tvoverlord addnew "someshow";= to start. \\
     For example: =tvoverlord addnew 'some tv show name';=


** How to use

**** Add new

: tvoverlord addnew SHOWNAME

TV Overlord will search thetvdb.com for a match to your show name.  If
it can't find the show you are looking for, it usually helps to add the
year to the name: =tvoverlord addnew 'show name year';=.

**** Show missing

: tvoverlord showmissing [--no-cache] [--today]

This will list any shows that are available to download.

 + =--no-cache= will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using the
   cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
 + =--today= will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
   only show yesterday's and older

**** Download

: tvoverlord download [--no-cache] [--today] [--ignore-warning] [--count NUM]
:                     [--location FILEPATH] [--provider NAME] [SHOWNAME]

For each show thats ready to download, it will ask you which one you
want to download.

 + =--count=  sets the number of results to display, the default is 5.
 + =--location=  sets the dir to download the nzb files to if you are using
   an nzb search engine.  This can be set in the ini file
 + =--provider=  will set the provider to use.  Look in the ini file to see
   how that can be specified there.  NAME can be a partial name
 + =--no-cache= will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using the
   cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
 + =--today= will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
   only show yesterday's and older
 + =--ignore-warning= does not check if you are connected to a vpn.
   This is documented in the tv_config.ini section


And finally, you can specify a single show to only download that show
instead of downloading all.

**** Calendar

: tvoverlord calendar [--no-cache] [--today] [--sort-by-next]
:                     [--no-color] [--days DAYS[,AFTER]] [SHOWNAME]

Display a calendar of all the current shows in your database.  It
defaults to the width of the console.

 + =--sort-by-next= sorts by order of next episode instead of by name.
 + =--days DAYS= will narrow the calendar to DAYS days.  For example,
   =--days 10= will show the next 10 days only.
 + =--days DAYS,AFTER= will display from DAYS to AFTER days.  For
   example, =--days 10,5= will display from the 10th day to the 15th day.
 + =--no-cache= will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using the
   cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
 + =--today= will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
   only show yesterday's and older

**** History

: tvoverlord history (list|copy|redownload) [CRITERIA]

The history command lets you view the status of previously downloaded
episodes and recopy or redownload the episode.  CRITERIA can be a
number, date or partial title of a show.

**** Info

: tvoverlord info [--no-cache] [--today] [--sort-by-next] [--show-links]
:                 [--synopsis] [--ask-inactive] [SHOWNAME]

This will show you what shows are next, and how many days till they
are broadcast.  Called without arguments, it lists all show except
shows marked inactive, in alphabetical order.  A single show can be
specified also.

 + =--sort-by-next= this will sort the shows by order of which episodes are next
 + =--show-links= will display links to imdb.com and thetvdb.com for
   each show
 + =--synopsis= will show a show synopsis for each show
 + =--ask-inactive=  When a show has been completely downloaded, and it
   has been cancelled or ended, it will ask you if you want to mark it
   inactive.

**** Search and download non tracked

: tvoverlord nondbshow [--count NUM] [--location FILEPATH]
:                      [--provider NAME] SEARCHTERM

This will show you matches to your search.  Anything downloaded this
way will not be recorded in your database.

 + =--count= is the number of search results to display
 + =--location= is where to download nzb files to
 + =--provider= will set the provider to use.  NAME can be a partial name

**** Providers

: tvoverlord providers

This will list search providers available to the program.  The default
one is the provider at the top of the list in config.ini.

**** Edit db info

: tvoverlord editdbinfo SHOWNAME

Edit the data in the database for show name.  You can manually set a
show as 'inactive' here if you wish.


** Configure

TV Overlord looks for the database and =config.ini= in the
=~/.tv_overlord/= directory.  If that directory doesn't exist, the app
will create it.

*** Configuration file sections

=[App Settings]=
 + =ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx= \\
   If used, TV Overlord will issue a warning if not connected to a
   vpn.  This should be you ip address when *not* connected to a vpn, so
   if your current ip matches this one, the program stops.  It uses
   http://api.ipify.org to get the current ip address.

 + =clean torrents: (yes|no)=\\
   If yes, the video file is extracted from the downloaded dir and
   renamed. For example:
   =Z.Nation.2x09.INTERNAL.720p.HDTV.x264-KILLERS[ettv].mkv= will be
   renamed to "=Z Nation S02E09 720p.mkv=" and then copied to the "=tv
   dir=" (description below).  If that directory doesn't have a dir
   called "Z Nation", it's created.

   If no, then whatever was downloaded gets copied to the "tv dir" and
   put into the "Z Nation" directory

=[Search Providers]=
 + This is a list of search providers that come with the application.
   The first one is the default.  The search engine used can be
   overridden on the command line with =--provider=PROVIDERNAME=

=[File Locations]=
 + =db file: FILEPATH= \\
   The location of the database.
 + =tv dir: FILEPATH= \\
   If specified, this is where the post download script will put the
   episodes.
 + =staging: FILEPATH= \\
   If using NZB searches, this is where the NZB files will be put.

** A note on pirating

Downloading shows via the Internet is much easier than watching them
on cable.  The shows are displayed in XBMC in a list and only the
shows I want to watch are listed.  This isn't about saving money, but
convenience.

The problem is that I don't want to be a thief by getting these shows
for free.  So, to make this work, I pay for the biggest cable package
I can, but I don't use it.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the same
as using TiVo and skipping the commercials.

If you want to download shows, you should do this too.
